# Releasing

The cut is one click: merge the release pull request. Everything either side of
that click is [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml),
and no npm credential exists on any machine — the publish authenticates to the
registry over OIDC (npm trusted publishing), so there is no token to leak and no
2FA prompt to answer. See [Publishing](#publishing).

This repository ships two packages from one tree: `byteguard` (the
bundler-agnostic core) and `vite-plugin-byteguard` (the Vite adapter, which
depends on the core). release-please runs in manifest mode over both; the
`node-workspace` plugin keeps them honest together — when the core releases,
the plugin's dependency range is bumped and the plugin releases too, so the
registry never holds a plugin that names a core version it cannot install.

## The loop

Every push to `main` runs `release.yml`, which hands the new commits to
[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action):

- **Nothing releasable since the last tags** → the run does nothing. Commit
  types release-please hides from the changelog (`docs`, `test`, `ci`,
  `build`, `chore`, `refactor`, `style`) do not open a release pull request on
  their own.
- **Something releasable** → it opens, or updates, a pull request containing
  only generated changes: each released package's `package.json` version and
  `CHANGELOG.md`, plus `.release-please-manifest.json`. `feat` bumps the
  minor, `fix` and `perf` bump the patch. A `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
  bumps the **minor** while a package is pre-1.0 (`bump-minor-pre-major`) —
  1.0.0 is a deliberate act, not the side effect of one commit. To force a
  version, put `Release-As: X.Y.Z` in a commit footer. Scope which package a
  commit releases by which files it touches — release-please attributes
  commits by path.
- **That pull request is merged** → the merge is a push to `main`, so
  `release.yml` runs again; this time release-please tags each released
  package (`byteguard-vX.Y.Z`, `vite-plugin-byteguard-vX.Y.Z`), creates the
  GitHub releases, and the same run publishes to npm — core first, then the
  plugin.

Squash-merge the release pull request, so the commit on `main` keeps its
generated `release:` subject.

## Where the version numbers start

`0.4.1` shipped to npm as a version-bump-only republish of the `v0.4.0` tree,
and that bump was recorded here afterwards — the commit tagged
`byteguard-v0.4.1` / `vite-plugin-byteguard-v0.4.1` is the source of the
published `0.4.1`. The manifest starts both packages there, and
`release-please-config.json` pins `bootstrap-sha` to that commit so the first
generated changelogs cover what follows it, not the whole repository. Neither
value is maintained afterwards.

## One-time setup (owner, GitHub)

**Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → tick "Allow GitHub
Actions to create and approve pull requests."** It is off by default, and while
it is off release-please cannot open the release pull request at all — the run
fails with *GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull
requests*. Nothing in a workflow file can grant this; it is a repository
setting.

The neighbouring "Workflow permissions" radio can stay on the read-only
default: `release.yml` declares per job the write scopes it needs.

## Cutting a release

1. Land the work on `main` with conventional-commit subjects. CI runs on every
   push.
2. Wait for the `release` run to open or update the release pull request.
3. Read the diff — the versions and the generated changelogs are the whole
   review. Optionally run the suite against the release branch: **Actions →
   ci → Run workflow →** the branch the pull request is on (see below for why
   it is not automatic).
4. **Merge it.** That is the cut.
5. Watch the second `release` run: it tags, creates the GitHub releases, and
   publishes.
6. Confirm: `npm view byteguard version` and
   `npm view vite-plugin-byteguard version`; each npm page shows the
   provenance attestation linking the tarball to the workflow run.

## Publishing

**Automated, on the release push.** The second `release` run — the one that
creates the tags — checks out the release commit (every tag it just created
points at that commit) and publishes each package whose release was created.
It authenticates over OIDC (npm trusted publishing): the runner exchanges a
short-lived GitHub token for a publish grant, so there is no `NPM_TOKEN` in
this repository and no OTP to type. That is what `id-token: write` in the
job's permissions is for, and it is also what lets the publish carry
`--provenance`.

`prepublishOnly` in each package runs its `tsup` build before npm packs
anything, and the workflow builds all workspaces first so the plugin's `.d.ts`
generation always finds the core's dist — even on a run where only the plugin
releases.

### The registry side (owner, npmjs.com)

**Not yet configured — this is the one step the automation cannot do.** The
form needs the package owner's npm account, once per package:

npmjs.com → *package* → **Settings** → **Trusted Publisher** → *GitHub
Actions*, filled in identically for **`byteguard`** and
**`vite-plugin-byteguard`**:

- Organization or user: `firejune`
- Repository: `byteguard`
- Workflow filename: `release.yml`
- Environment name: *blank* (the workflow declares no environment; a value
  here that the workflow does not match rejects the publish)

The fields are case-sensitive and npm does not validate them on save, so a
typo only surfaces as a failed publish.

Two properties of that configuration are load-bearing in the workflow:

- The publish steps must live in **`release.yml`**. Renaming the file, or
  moving a publish into another workflow, breaks the trusted publisher until
  the form is updated to match.
- They must run on a **GitHub-hosted runner**. npm does not support trusted
  publishing from self-hosted runners, so this job never moves to a private
  machine.

**The next release is the first automated publish, and only that run can prove
the OIDC exchange** — everything up to the registry is testable here, the
token swap itself is not. Watch it: **Actions → release →** the run for the
release commit, the *Publish … to npm* steps. A rejection there names its own
cause; a mismatch against the trusted publisher form above is the first thing
to re-read, since npm matches the claim by repository and workflow filename
and accepts no approximation of it.

### If the automation is unavailable

The old path still works and needs nothing from the workflow. Publish from the
tagged tree, never from a working `main`:

```sh
npm login                        # once per machine; `npm whoami` to check
git fetch --tags
git checkout byteguard-vX.Y.Z    # or vite-plugin-byteguard-vX.Y.Z
npm ci
npm run build
npm publish --workspace packages/byteguard           # asks for the OTP
npm publish --workspace packages/vite-plugin-byteguard
```

Publish only the package(s) the tag names, core before plugin. This
authenticates as a logged-in human with a one-time password. Reach for it when
the automation is broken and a release cannot wait — then fix the workflow.

## Why the release pull request has no CI checks

A pull request opened with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` starts no other workflow
runs — GitHub suppresses that to prevent recursive runs — so `ci.yml` does not
fire on release-please's pull request. The usual fix is a personal access
token, and this repository deliberately does not use one:

- The base of the release pull request is a commit on `main` that `ci.yml`
  already tested on push.
- The pull request adds only generated version and changelog text. There is no
  source change for a test run to have an opinion about.
- The token would be the only long-lived credential in the repository.

A push of your own to the release branch (say, to resolve a conflict) is not
`GITHUB_TOKEN`'s, so it does start a `pull_request` run — which then sits in
`action_required` until approved from the Actions tab. And the release branch
is named by release-please from its config, so do not hard-code it; anything
scripted reads it from the pull request: `gh pr view <n> --json headRefName`.

If a rendered check is ever wanted anyway, it takes no edit to `release.yml`:
create a fine-grained personal access token scoped to this repository with
**Contents: read and write** and **Pull requests: read and write**, store it
as the repository secret `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN`, and the workflow picks it up
(`secrets.RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`). The cost is a
credential to rotate.
